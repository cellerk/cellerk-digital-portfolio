# Diatoma Biofilm Modeling

The aim of my MSc thesis project was to explain by numerical modeling how different colony architectures of Diatoma microbial streamers are formed in rivers. I developed a mass-and-spring mechanical model of filament formation, coupling individual-based models for biofilm formation, including microbial growth, attachment and detachment, with river hydrodynamics
