````
````{card} **Postdoctoral Fellow, UBC Botany Department, 2014-2016**
- Studied dynamic microtubule restructuring during growth and development in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. 
- Focused on: (1) correlative microscopy and electron tomography to uncover how microtubule bundling at cell edges translates cellular signals into cell wall and shape modifications, dictating developmental transitions; (2) mathematical modeling to explore the gene regulatory networks involved in these transitions integrating single cell models into a multicellular spatial context.
